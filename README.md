## üöÄ Setup Instructions
![Screenshot (1296)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fac07f0b-a1a5-4f02-b418-b3289948967a)


## Step 1: Clone the Repository
            Download the project source code to your local system.
            
            git clone https://github.com/vengadesh-max/Event_triggerX-App.git
            cd Event_TriggerX
Explanation: The git clone command copies the project from GitHub, and cd navigates to the project directory.
## Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment
            Set up an isolated Python environment for the project dependencies.
            
## For Linux/Mac
            python -m venv venv
            source venv/bin/activate

## For Windows
            python -m venv venv
            venv\Scripts\activate
Explanation:
python -m venv venv creates a virtual environment named venv.
source (Linux/Mac) or venv\Scripts\activate (Windows) activates the environment.

## Step 3: Install Dependencies
            Install the required libraries and packages.
            pip install -r requirements.txt
Explanation: This command reads the requirements.txt file and installs all necessary dependencies for the project.

## Step 4: Set Up the Database
            Initialize the database to ensure proper setup.
            python -c "from app.database import init_db; init_db()"
Explanation: This runs a script to set up the database tables and structure (using SQLite or any configured database).

## Step 5: Run the Application
            Start the FastAPI server in development mode.
            uvicorn app.main:app --reload
Explanation:
uvicorn is the server that runs the FastAPI app.
--reload automatically restarts the server upon file changes.

## Access the App:

            Swagger UI: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
            Redoc UI: http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc
## Step 6: Run with Docker :
            If you prefer running the project in a Docker container:
            docker-compose up --build
Explanation: This builds the Docker image and runs the project in a containerized environment.

### Run command  : uvicorn app.main:app --reload :

)

## Next step : add \docs to the local hosted link = > 

#### When you add /docs to your FastAPI local server link, such as http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs, it opens the Swagger UI that FastAPI automatically generates for your application.
